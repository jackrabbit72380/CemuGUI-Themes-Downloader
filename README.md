CemuGUI Themes Downloader is a bit diffrent from the themes chooser app in the cemugui app.

Whats diffrent you might ask? Well this app uses smaller jpg images for preview pictures so you can have fast easy accsess to the themes downloads 

the larger counterparts and high resolution preview pictures are for the cemugui appliaction. where as this is more of a user testing tool. for link verification. 

the app is also made to be a minamal link testing version of the larger themes chooser included in the gui flow appliactions.

You may use it how ever you like just to have some fun! show your friends or maybe you just want to browes the themes with out launching the larger app.

what ever the case is we say go for it! Dont forget to create your owen high quality custom theme and upload it to us we love new content!
